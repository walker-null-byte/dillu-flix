00:00:53.992 --> 00:00:55.028
Some Mornings,

2
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.552
I wake up crying without knowing why.

3
00:00:58.732 --> 00:01:00.680
That sort of thing happens now and again.

4
00:01:02.176 --> 00:01:03.640
Whatever the dream was I had,

5
00:01:04.424 --> 00:01:05.684
I can never remember it.

6
00:01:06.512 --> 00:01:07.064
But...

7
00:01:08.132 --> 00:01:08.628
But...

8
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.628
The only thing that does last
when I wake up,

9
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.572
Is a sense of loss.

10
00:01:14.664 --> 00:01:16.952
Which lingers for a long time afterwards.

11
00:01:23.932 --> 00:01:25.608
I'm always searching for something

12
00:01:26.824 --> 00:01:27.840
Or someone.

13
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.972
I've been consumed by this feeling,

14
00:01:31.992 --> 00:01:33.284
Ever since that day...

15
00:01:35.024 --> 00:01:37.772
The day a star fell.

16
00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:40.084
It was almost like...

17
00:01:40.512 --> 00:01:42.428
Like seeing something out of a dream.

18
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.284
Nothing more or less...

19
00:01:46.516 --> 00:01:48.028
Than a breathtaking view.

20
00:01:49.064 --> 00:01:52.712
If only our voices speak at night

21
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.572
Could ever reach the very edge
of this world and the time.

22
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.952
Instead of fading into air and dust

23
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.512
Then what will the words could ever be ?
Farthest words from 'probably'

24
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.156
Let's make a promise that will never fade
Let's say it together in count of three oh

25
00:02:27.796 --> 00:02:30.932
I'm told that some part of
every wish will be heard,

26
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.640
But lately I lost sight of
the truth in those words

27
00:02:33.712 --> 00:02:38.512
I can't even remember when I gave up believing
What could have been the reason ?

28
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.440
The very moment that the rain will stop
and the place rainbow born and dies

29
00:02:44.552 --> 00:02:46.352
And where the end of this life lies

30
00:02:46.592 --> 00:02:49.352
I've always been insisting there was
something that I've longing for

31
00:02:54.792 --> 00:02:59.772
One day we'll reach to emotions
unexplored unprecedented

32
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.492
We will high five love we've yet to
discover and give a kiss to time

33
00:03:04.712 --> 00:03:10.204
The five dimensions keep on teasing me
But I will keep on looking at you dear

34
00:03:10.628 --> 00:03:14.284
Let's make a sign for when we say
Nice to meet you again

35
00:03:16.284 --> 00:03:19.256
I'm on my way to you,
chasing after your name

36
00:03:44.248 --> 00:03:44.952
Taki.

37
00:03:46.224 --> 00:03:47.028
Taki.

38
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.040
Taki.

39
00:03:50.684 --> 00:03:52.280
Don't you remember ?

40
00:03:55.372 --> 00:03:56.464
My name is...

41
00:03:58.444 --> 00:03:59.280
Mitsuha

42
00:04:35.428 --> 00:04:37.972
Sis, what are you doing ?

43
00:04:38.084 --> 00:04:41.392
Whoa, they're so realistic feeling

44
00:04:42.132 --> 00:04:43.732
Sis ?
Me ?

45
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.972
Are you still asleep ?
Breakfast time

46
00:04:47.028 --> 00:04:47.912
Hurry up

47
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.372
What ?

48
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.516
Do you wanna have any
last night's fish, Grandma ?

49
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.480
You can eat it.

50
00:05:24.792 --> 00:05:26.240
- Morning
- Morning

51
00:05:26.372 --> 00:05:28.112
Lazy butt, you're so slow

52
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.648
I'll make breakfast tomorrow

53
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.064
Oh, that's a lot.

54
00:05:37.552 --> 00:05:38.112
Oh well.

55
00:05:38.976 --> 00:05:40.532
You're back to normal today.

56
00:05:41.312 --> 00:05:43.376
You were so crazy yesterday.

57
00:05:43.484 --> 00:05:44.972
What do you mean crazy ?

58
00:05:47.084 --> 00:05:48.804
Attention citizens of Itomori.

59
00:05:49.428 --> 00:05:50.084
Good Morning,

60
00:05:50.716 --> 00:05:53.772
This is an official announcement
from Itomori Town Hall.

61
00:05:54.448 --> 00:05:56.512
It is in regards to the mayoral election

62
00:05:57.392 --> 00:05:59.864
The election will be held
on the 20th of next month,

63
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.532
The election committee will
like to remind everyone that,

64
00:06:06.824 --> 00:06:12.284
A comet that only comes once every 1200 years
Will finally headed our way in a month.

65
00:06:12.884 --> 00:06:17.096
The comet will be visible to naked eye,
For several days once it approaches the earth.

66
00:06:17.128 --> 00:06:19.248
Just make it up with him already okay ?

67
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.468
It's an adult matter.

68
00:06:20.512 --> 00:06:24.972
According to jaxa spokeperson, they are
preparing for celestial show of the millennium.

69
00:06:41.512 --> 00:06:42.572
We're leaving

70
00:06:46.468 --> 00:06:49.628
I can't wait for the festival
It's gonna be so much fun.

71
00:07:03.772 --> 00:07:05.064
Study hard, Sis

72
00:07:08.448 --> 00:07:08.924
Oh

73
00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:12.064
Mitsuha

74
00:07:12.468 --> 00:07:14.288
Morning Sayaka,
Morning Tessie

75
00:07:14.372 --> 00:07:14.992
Morning.

76
00:07:15.264 --> 00:07:16.912
Come on, would you get off already ?

77
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.372
- What for ?
- Meanie

78
00:07:18.424 --> 00:07:19.756
- Cause you're heavy,
- Hey that's rude

79
00:07:19.776 --> 00:07:22.448
You know I gotta say,
You two make a great couple

80
00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:23.356
No, we don't

81
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.736
Oh, I see you actually bothered
to do your hair today.

82
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:29.736
Wait what ?

83
00:07:29.792 --> 00:07:32.888
Oh yeah, what happen ?
Did your grandma exercise all your demons.

84
00:07:32.972 --> 00:07:33.792
Exercise ?

85
00:07:33.952 --> 00:07:35.912
Something totally possessed your body.

86
00:07:36.332 --> 00:07:38.952
Would you just give it a rest
with all this occult nonsense ?

87
00:07:39.352 --> 00:07:41.828
Mitsuha has got to be feeling
stressed enough as it is. Right ?

88
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.480
What are you guys talking about ?

89
00:07:43.792 --> 00:07:44.956
Are you feeling okay ?

90
00:07:46.932 --> 00:07:48.112
And above all,

91
00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:53.596
Restoring the town's fiscal health,
So we can continue our revitalization project

92
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.112
Its only when all these thing are achieved

93
00:07:56.224 --> 00:07:59.428
That we can create a safe
and secure community.

94
00:08:00.024 --> 00:08:02.464
And as the incumbent
My administration

95
00:08:02.512 --> 00:08:05.040
Miyamizu is gonna get another term anyway.

96
00:08:05.064 --> 00:08:08.064
I hear he's been going out the pork
Just between us.

97
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.268
Hey, Miyamizu

98
00:08:09.772 --> 00:08:10.372
Morning.

99
00:08:11.752 --> 00:08:15.064
Look likes the mayor and contractor's
kid are pretty cozy too.

100
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:15.840
Ew.

101
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.000
To improve the quality of life
Of each & every resident

102
00:08:20.932 --> 00:08:21.712
Mitsuha

103
00:08:22.792 --> 00:08:24.480
Stand up straight when you are walking.

104
00:08:25.756 --> 00:08:28.880
- Oh, he is tough on his family
- That's the mayor for you

105
00:08:29.048 --> 00:08:31.332
- Awkward
- Sucks to be her

106
00:08:32.664 --> 00:08:33.448
Mitsuha

107
00:08:34.992 --> 00:08:36.356
In front of everyone...

108
00:08:40.008 --> 00:08:41.088
Who are you ?

109
00:08:50.556 --> 00:08:51.172
Twilight

110
00:08:51.952 --> 00:08:53.712
That's the origin of word Twilight,

111
00:08:54.064 --> 00:08:56.116
I am sure everyone here
knows that word.

112
00:08:56.884 --> 00:08:57.648
It's dusk,

113
00:08:57.772 --> 00:08:59.880
A time when it is neither day nor night.

114
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.512
When the border between worlds blurs,

115
00:09:02.736 --> 00:09:05.268
And one might encounter
something not human.

116
00:09:06.684 --> 00:09:08.640
Another older term for it,

117
00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.028
It's dusk light.

118
00:09:10.828 --> 00:09:13.480
Some people also called it golden hour

119
00:09:13.576 --> 00:09:16.228
What about magic hour ?
It's something my grandma say

120
00:09:16.512 --> 00:09:19.840
Well golden hour and magic hour,
Are technically the same

121
00:09:20.248 --> 00:09:22.280
But it's a term that mostly photographers  use

122
00:09:23.464 --> 00:09:25.280
Well, she does take lot of pictures.

123
00:09:25.512 --> 00:09:26.880
Who are you ?

124
00:09:28.224 --> 00:09:30.772
Ok next, Miyamizu

125
00:09:31.264 --> 00:09:31.864
Yes.

126
00:09:32.392 --> 00:09:35.608
Well, I can see you remember,
your own name today.

127
00:09:39.064 --> 00:09:40.680
You don't remember ?

128
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.400
Well, believe it or not, you forgot where
your own desk and locker where yesterday

129
00:09:46.064 --> 00:09:49.552
Plus, you have the worst case of bedhead and
You didn't have your ribbon on either

130
00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.372
What ?
No way

131
00:09:54.684 --> 00:09:56.952
Yeah it was like,
you had amnesia or something

132
00:09:57.424 --> 00:10:01.532
Now you have mention it,
I do feel like I've been having weird dreams lately...

133
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.444
Like a dream about someone else's life ?

134
00:10:06.196 --> 00:10:07.248
It's all so fuzzy.

135
00:10:08.392 --> 00:10:09.112
Wait a sec...

136
00:10:09.532 --> 00:10:10.280
I've got it

137
00:10:10.736 --> 00:10:12.640
It's memory from a previous life

138
00:10:12.712 --> 00:10:16.428
Or maybe your subconscious linked to
the ever interpretation of a multiverse.

139
00:10:16.516 --> 00:10:17.640
Keep your full mouth shut

140
00:10:17.712 --> 00:10:21.080
Wait a minute, Tessie don't tell me
you're the one who wrote in my notebook ?

141
00:10:23.172 --> 00:10:23.792
Forget it.

142
00:10:25.424 --> 00:10:28.732
But you are really were acting
just a little funny yesterday Mitsuha

143
00:10:29.884 --> 00:10:31.112
You been feeling okay ?

144
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.664
That was weird.

145
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.428
I feel fine.

146
00:10:35.684 --> 00:10:37.112
Maybe it's from stress.

147
00:10:37.312 --> 00:10:39.640
You know you got that ritual is coming soon,
Don't you ?

148
00:10:39.912 --> 00:10:41.576
Oh, don't remind me

149
00:10:41.888 --> 00:10:43.800
I can't stand this place anymore.

150
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.176
It's too small and towny.

151
00:10:46.536 --> 00:10:49.972
I want to graduate already and
go to Tokyo as soon as I can.

152
00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.248
I can't say I blame you.

153
00:10:52.972 --> 00:10:55.288
There's really is nothing at all in this town.

154
00:10:57.248 --> 00:10:59.744
There's only one train that
stops here every 2 hours.

155
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.712
And all the stores closes at 9 o'clock

156
00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.732
No bookstore
No dentist.

157
00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.356
But two cocktail lounges for whatever reason.

158
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.280
No jobs in town.

159
00:11:07.352 --> 00:11:08.532
No one date-able.

160
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.512
Even the days are too short.

161
00:11:12.512 --> 00:11:13.572
You know what ?

162
00:11:13.624 --> 00:11:14.640
No what ?

163
00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.512
Forget that stuff...
Why don't we got to a café ?

164
00:11:18.628 --> 00:11:19.628
- Really ?
- A café ?

165
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.280
Where ?

166
00:11:26.064 --> 00:11:26.840
Hello kids.

167
00:11:26.884 --> 00:11:27.776
- Evening ma'am.
- Hi there.

168
00:11:33.196 --> 00:11:34.628
How is this is a café ?

169
00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.296
Like this town's got a café.

170
00:11:37.152 --> 00:11:39.112
Mitsuha just went straight home.

171
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.176
Things have got to be really
rough for her right now.

172
00:11:43.404 --> 00:11:45.192
She's on center stage and all.

173
00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.228
Yeah.

174
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.228
Hey, Tessie.

175
00:11:51.532 --> 00:11:52.000
Huh ?

176
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.592
What are you going to do after
you graduate high school ?

177
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.268
Where did that come from ?

178
00:11:57.512 --> 00:11:58.840
You talking about the future ?

179
00:12:00.868 --> 00:12:01.480
I don't know.

180
00:12:01.992 --> 00:12:04.448
I think I'll probably just end up
living in this town you know ?

181
00:12:04.752 --> 00:12:05.372
Same as ever.

182
00:12:22.064 --> 00:12:23.936
I want to do what you're doing.

183
00:12:24.116 --> 00:12:26.840
It's still too soon for you to try, Yotsuha.

184
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Listen to the thread's voice.

185
00:12:29.484 --> 00:12:32.312
When you twine it round and round like this,

186
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.600
feelings will start flowing
between you and the thread.

187
00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:38.480
It's not like threads talk.

188
00:12:38.776 --> 00:12:40.136
She's telling you to focus.

189
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.332
Etched within our braided cords is
1,000 years worth of Itomori's history

190
00:12:46.712 --> 00:12:50.512
Listen something happened 200 years ago...

191
00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:51.880
Here she goes.

192
00:12:52.192 --> 00:12:58.992
The bathroom of sandal maker Mayugoro Yamasaki
caught on fire and this whole area burned down.

193
00:12:59.372 --> 00:13:02.080
The shrine and old documents were destroyed.

194
00:13:02.992 --> 00:13:04.280
and this is known as...

195
00:13:04.312 --> 00:13:06.028
Mayugoro's Great Fire.

196
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:10.192
They named the fire after him ?
I feel bad for Mayugoro.

197
00:13:11.572 --> 00:13:14.880
The meaning behind our festivals
was lost because of that.

198
00:13:15.264 --> 00:13:17.040
Only the surface was left.

199
00:13:17.952 --> 00:13:21.880
But even if those words are gone,
the tradition shouldn't fade.

200
00:13:22.172 --> 00:13:26.064
That's the Miyamizu Shrine's duty.
Our important task.

201
00:13:28.992 --> 00:13:32.640
Despite all that,
that son-in-law of mine...

202
00:13:32.972 --> 00:13:36.752
Abandoning the Shinto priesthood and
leaving this house were bad enough,

203
00:13:37.048 --> 00:13:40.292
But politics ?
He's hopeless.

204
00:13:41.552 --> 00:13:43.040
Have another, Mr. Foreman.

205
00:13:43.248 --> 00:13:45.592
Man, you say we got tricky one that for sure

206
00:13:46.668 --> 00:13:49.372
I'm counting on your help again for this election.

207
00:13:49.424 --> 00:13:50.372
Leave it to me.

208
00:13:50.484 --> 00:13:54.280
You'll get votes from the Kadoiri
and Sakagami Districts guaranteed.

209
00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.556
How's the dating scene ?

210
00:13:55.624 --> 00:13:57.192
It ain't easy that's for sure.

211
00:13:59.428 --> 00:14:01.152
Smells like corruption in there.

212
00:14:01.624 --> 00:14:03.192
What are you talking about ?

213
00:14:04.224 --> 00:14:05.992
We're gonna need two or
three more bottles.

214
00:14:05.996 --> 00:14:06.880
Yes dear.

215
00:14:07.064 --> 00:14:09.912
Katsuhiko, you're going to help
out at the site this weekend.

216
00:14:10.084 --> 00:14:12.712
We'll be using explosives,
so you better study up.

217
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.468
What was that ?

218
00:14:14.716 --> 00:14:17.468
Got it

219
00:14:29.332 --> 00:14:31.640
Guess we both can't stand things here.

220
00:14:50.512 --> 00:14:52.772
Is that Yotsuha ?
She's all grown up.

221
00:14:53.352 --> 00:14:55.640
They're lookers right just like their mother.

222
00:14:57.684 --> 00:14:58.112
Hey.

223
00:14:59.192 --> 00:14:59.684
Hey.

224
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.576
World's oldest kind of sake.

225
00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:40.572
By chewing on rice, spitting it out, and
letting it ferment naturally it becomes alcohol.

226
00:15:40.816 --> 00:15:42.284
Kuchikamisake.

227
00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.680
Do the gods really appreciate that ?
The way it's

228
00:15:45.712 --> 00:15:47.192
Yeah of course they do.

229
00:15:49.792 --> 00:15:51.684
Hey, check it out.
It's Miyamizu.

230
00:15:58.228 --> 00:15:59.372
I'd never do that

231
00:16:00.132 --> 00:16:01.792
And in front of everybody...

232
00:16:01.912 --> 00:16:03.268
Embarrassing right ?

233
00:16:17.684 --> 00:16:19.356
You should try to cheer up, Sis.

234
00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.992
Who cares if a few the kids
from your school saw that ?

235
00:16:23.144 --> 00:16:25.712
It must be nice for you
not being a teenager.

236
00:16:26.512 --> 00:16:30.840
Hey, I know You should just sell
kuchikamisake and move to Tokyo.

237
00:16:30.884 --> 00:16:31.064
What ?

238
00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:35.680
I bet you could sell it with all sort of
stuff like photos and making OV videos.

239
00:16:35.972 --> 00:16:39.480
Oh and then you can call it
"Shrine Maiden's Sake."

240
00:16:39.712 --> 00:16:41.064
You'll make boatloads

241
00:16:41.912 --> 00:16:44.116
"Shrine Maiden's Sake"

242
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.592
I can't there are Liquor Laws

243
00:16:48.376 --> 00:16:50.080
That's what you have a problem with ?

244
00:16:56.532 --> 00:16:58.532
I hate this town,

245
00:16:59.132 --> 00:17:01.376
I hate this life too.

246
00:17:01.464 --> 00:17:05.132
Please make me a handsome
Tokyo boy in my next life

247
00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.000
What a jackass...

248
00:17:40.372 --> 00:17:41.152
Ow

249
00:17:43.512 --> 00:17:44.400
Ouch...

250
00:17:54.352 --> 00:17:55.280
Where...

251
00:18:06.608 --> 00:18:08.688
Something's there...

252
00:18:22.912 --> 00:18:23.400
Ow

253
00:18:23.912 --> 00:18:25.200
Taki, are you up ?

254
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.228
It was your turn to cook
breakfast wasn't it ?

255
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.372
Did you sleep in ?

256
00:18:31.532 --> 00:18:32.712
I'm sorry.

257
00:18:34.712 --> 00:18:35.640
I'm heading out.

258
00:18:36.112 --> 00:18:37.064
Finish the miso.

259
00:18:38.152 --> 00:18:38.732
Ok.

260
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.536
Make sure that you go to school.
Even if you're late.

261
00:18:41.932 --> 00:18:42.428
See you.

262
00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.772
Have a nice day.

263
00:18:56.352 --> 00:18:57.712
What a strange dream.

264
00:18:59.372 --> 00:19:02.356
From Tsukasa: Run, you're late

265
00:19:03.392 --> 00:19:03.792
Huh ?

266
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.000
It's from Tsukasa ?

267
00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.600
Who's that ?

268
00:19:17.392 --> 00:19:21.728
I gotta go pee.

269
00:19:28.332 --> 00:19:29.252
Way too real.

270
00:20:20.248 --> 00:20:22.112
"Shinjuku Station"

271
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.372
I'm in Tokyo.

272
00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.640
"Jingu High School"

273
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.996
Where'd you get this ?
- Daikanyama.

274
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.428
Guess who's opening on our next gig...

275
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.572
Hey let's skip club stuff today
and catch a movie.

276
00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:02.800
Taki

277
00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:05.912
Can't believe you got in at noon

278
00:21:06.392 --> 00:21:07.312
Come on, let's grab lunch.

279
00:21:08.912 --> 00:21:10.392
You ignored my text too.

280
00:21:11.392 --> 00:21:12.480
Oh, Mr. Tsukasa ?

281
00:21:12.532 --> 00:21:13.196
Mister ?

282
00:21:13.584 --> 00:21:14.792
You don't have to go that far.

283
00:21:16.796 --> 00:21:18.152
You got lost ?

284
00:21:18.248 --> 00:21:18.800
Yeah.

285
00:21:19.028 --> 00:21:19.976
Wait a second.

286
00:21:20.136 --> 00:21:22.912
How'd you wind up getting
lost on the way to school ?

287
00:21:23.132 --> 00:21:23.732
Uh...

288
00:21:24.228 --> 00:21:25.868
Well... A girl...

289
00:21:25.928 --> 00:21:26.428
A girl ?

290
00:21:26.608 --> 00:21:27.572
A gal

291
00:21:28.808 --> 00:21:29.572
I mean...

292
00:21:30.448 --> 00:21:31.132
A guy

293
00:21:33.448 --> 00:21:35.372
You know, guys just want to have fun.

294
00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.248
Everyday is a festival,
when you're living in Tokyo.

295
00:21:38.512 --> 00:21:39.028
As a guy.

296
00:21:39.952 --> 00:21:41.952
Hey, you sound funny.

297
00:21:42.392 --> 00:21:43.372
And where's your lunch ?

298
00:21:44.312 --> 00:21:45.280
Seriously ?

299
00:21:45.464 --> 00:21:46.772
What is up with you ?

300
00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:47.992
We could share something.

301
00:21:48.284 --> 00:21:50.040
Lets make a Croquette-egg sandwich

302
00:21:50.532 --> 00:21:51.312
Yes

303
00:21:54.732 --> 00:21:55.680
Thank you.

304
00:21:57.948 --> 00:21:59.228
Wanna hit the café later ?

305
00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.192
Oh that one ?

306
00:22:00.624 --> 00:22:01.000
Sure.

307
00:22:01.312 --> 00:22:02.000
You in, Taki ?

308
00:22:02.048 --> 00:22:02.428
What ?

309
00:22:03.192 --> 00:22:03.572
What ?

310
00:22:04.316 --> 00:22:04.640
What ?

311
00:22:05.228 --> 00:22:06.088
A café ?

312
00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.552
They got nice timber work in here.

313
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.312
Yeah, its pretty intricate.

314
00:22:14.024 --> 00:22:15.000
Taki, all set ?

315
00:22:16.792 --> 00:22:17.112
What ?

316
00:22:17.792 --> 00:22:20.572
I could live for a month on
what these pancakes cost

317
00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.868
Uh, maybe a decade ago...

318
00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:24.888
Hmm.

319
00:22:25.912 --> 00:22:26.640
Oh well.

320
00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:27.976
It's only a dream

321
00:22:34.684 --> 00:22:35.800
Dreams are great.

322
00:22:41.684 --> 00:22:42.840
What ?
Oh no,

323
00:22:43.248 --> 00:22:44.840
I think that I'm late for work

324
00:22:45.248 --> 00:22:46.512
You got a shift today ?

325
00:22:46.932 --> 00:22:47.972
Guess you better get going.

326
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:48.972
Oh, right.

327
00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.680
Oh sorry but...

328
00:22:54.024 --> 00:22:56.496
Where exactly do I work ?

329
00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:57.600
What ?

330
00:23:04.176 --> 00:23:06.080
Tables 6, 7, and 10 are waiting

331
00:23:06.792 --> 00:23:08.040
Table 12, Taki

332
00:23:08.512 --> 00:23:09.000
Got it

333
00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.336
Here you go.

334
00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.572
So, the zucchini and tomato salad...

335
00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:15.736
We didn't order that.
What ?

336
00:23:15.824 --> 00:23:18.512
Taki, I told you that
we are out of truffles

337
00:23:18.572 --> 00:23:20.352
Taki, you got to talk louder

338
00:23:20.372 --> 00:23:21.000
Taki

339
00:23:22.848 --> 00:23:24.932
When is this nightmare going to be over ?

340
00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.240
Waiter.

341
00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:35.496
Hey you.

342
00:23:35.824 --> 00:23:36.956
Oh, yes ?

343
00:23:38.952 --> 00:23:39.796
See this ?

344
00:23:39.824 --> 00:23:41.684
Does it look right ?
A toothpick is in it.

345
00:23:42.848 --> 00:23:44.828
What would have happened
If we ate it ?

346
00:23:45.804 --> 00:23:48.000
It's really lucky I noticed when I did.

347
00:23:49.152 --> 00:23:50.000
Do something.

348
00:23:50.112 --> 00:23:51.976
Uh, it's just that...

349
00:23:52.972 --> 00:23:56.892
Well I don't even think
we have toothpicks at this

350
00:23:56.912 --> 00:23:57.640
What ?

351
00:23:58.932 --> 00:23:59.932
Excuse me.

352
00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.428
Is everything alright over here ?

353
00:24:02.624 --> 00:24:04.880
Well, like I was trying to tell the guy...

354
00:24:03.488 --> 00:24:04.372
I'll take care of this.

355
00:24:06.352 --> 00:24:07.648
What's wrong with you today ?

356
00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.088
We truly apologize.

357
00:24:11.296 --> 00:24:12.772
Your meal is on the house tonight.

358
00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:13.772
Why thank you.

359
00:24:14.088 --> 00:24:15.552
You weren't hurt were you ?

360
00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:27.316
Um...

361
00:24:27.972 --> 00:24:28.796
Okudera...

362
00:24:28.952 --> 00:24:30.000
That's Miss to you

363
00:24:31.172 --> 00:24:32.992
Ms. Okudera about before...

364
00:24:32.996 --> 00:24:34.572
We just had some bad luck is all.

365
00:24:34.912 --> 00:24:35.588
No, I...

366
00:24:35.592 --> 00:24:37.736
Those guys were definitely scamming us.

367
00:24:38.352 --> 00:24:41.024
I handled it according to the manual,
But still...

368
00:24:42.268 --> 00:24:44.116
Oh, Ms. Okudera,
your skirt

369
00:24:45.952 --> 00:24:46.868
Are you alright ?

370
00:24:47.228 --> 00:24:48.000
Did something happen ?

371
00:24:48.112 --> 00:24:49.332
Looks like someone cut it.

372
00:24:50.152 --> 00:24:51.000
That guy...

373
00:24:51.352 --> 00:24:52.000
What now ?

374
00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.712
Do you remember what he looked like ?

375
00:24:53.752 --> 00:24:54.280
No.

376
00:24:55.064 --> 00:24:55.752
Come with me.

377
00:24:57.028 --> 00:24:58.240
Hey, Taki

378
00:24:59.592 --> 00:25:00.884
Okay take off your skirt.

379
00:25:00.912 --> 00:25:01.372
What ?

380
00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.280
What ?
No I'll look the other way

381
00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.576
Hold on, this won't take long.

382
00:25:14.192 --> 00:25:15.760
All done
Ta-dah

383
00:25:16.828 --> 00:25:20.000
You're really good Taki.
It's way cuter now

384
00:25:21.984 --> 00:25:25.372
By the way, I wanted to thank you for all
your help with that customer earlier...

385
00:25:27.116 --> 00:25:30.352
To be honest
Well, I was worried about you.

386
00:25:31.064 --> 00:25:34.132
You're weren't that strong but
you're quick to pick a fight.

387
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.480
I like you better today.

388
00:25:37.372 --> 00:25:40.640
You got a feminine side.
Who would have guessed ?

389
00:25:42.028 --> 00:25:43.916
"JR Yamanote Line: 8 min."

390
00:25:51.512 --> 00:25:52.440
I got to say...

391
00:25:52.712 --> 00:25:54.680
This dream sure does seems real.

392
00:25:59.352 --> 00:26:01.268
Oh, looks like he keeps a journal.

393
00:26:06.512 --> 00:26:07.552
He's so organized.

394
00:26:08.712 --> 00:26:10.228
I wish I lived in Tokyo.

395
00:26:13.912 --> 00:26:15.912
Oh one of her

396
00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.680
Unrequited love ?

397
00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:34.592
"Walked to the station with Ms. Okudera
after work, thanks to my feminine powers"

398
00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.372
Who are you ?

399
00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.868
Mitsuha

400
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
What is this ?

401
00:27:08.004 --> 00:27:09.392
Mitsuha

402
00:27:12.524 --> 00:27:13.152
What

403
00:27:13.912 --> 00:27:14.428
What... ?

404
00:27:14.884 --> 00:27:15.372
"Thanks to my feminine powers"

405
00:27:15.428 --> 00:27:16.680
What's going on

406
00:27:18.732 --> 00:27:20.028
So, café today ?

407
00:27:20.172 --> 00:27:21.932
Thanks, but I got to go to work.

408
00:27:22.664 --> 00:27:24.576
Do you remember where to go ?

409
00:27:26.696 --> 00:27:28.512
Wait a second, was that you Tsukasa ?

410
00:27:28.712 --> 00:27:30.196
Are you the one that's been
messing with my phone ?

411
00:27:30.872 --> 00:27:34.280
Oh, never mind
Later.

412
00:27:35.204 --> 00:27:37.448
Well, he's back to normal.

413
00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.428
I think he was kind of cute yesterday.

414
00:27:40.592 --> 00:27:41.376
Uhh...

415
00:27:45.576 --> 00:27:46.240
What's up ?

416
00:27:46.312 --> 00:27:48.576
Don't play dumb.
What about bro code huh ?

417
00:27:48.628 --> 00:27:50.640
Yeah, You walked home
with her yesterday right ?

418
00:27:53.172 --> 00:27:54.396
What are you talking about ?

419
00:27:54.572 --> 00:27:55.696
Me and Ms. Okudera ?

420
00:27:55.712 --> 00:27:57.280
So what did you guys do ?

421
00:27:57.828 --> 00:28:00.736
Well, I don't remember actually.

422
00:28:00.748 --> 00:28:02.280
Quit messing around and tell us

423
00:28:02.732 --> 00:28:04.732
Okudera reporting for duty

424
00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.152
- Don't slack off today you guys.
- Yeah.

425
00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.640
We're going to have a good day today.

426
00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.000
Aren't we, Taki ?

427
00:28:22.892 --> 00:28:26.372
Mitsuha, Who are you ?
What are you ?

428
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.840
I see you're not touching
your boobies today.

429
00:28:30.064 --> 00:28:31.240
Breakfast time

430
00:28:31.428 --> 00:28:32.372
Hurry up

431
00:28:35.936 --> 00:28:36.916
My boobs ?

432
00:28:39.684 --> 00:28:40.596
Morning.

433
00:28:46.776 --> 00:28:49.796
I feel like everyone is
staring at me for some reason.

434
00:28:50.468 --> 00:28:53.008
Well you did kind of make
a scene yesterday.

435
00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:53.800
Huh ?

436
00:28:55.172 --> 00:28:56.284
"Still life drawing"

437
00:28:56.312 --> 00:28:58.336
Did you see all the election posters ?

438
00:28:58.532 --> 00:29:00.628
Doesn't matter who wins.
Nothing will change.

439
00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:01.880
Except for who gets the kick-backs.

440
00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.376
Shh Somebody's daddy depending on it.

441
00:29:06.392 --> 00:29:08.000
They're talking about me, right ?

442
00:29:08.332 --> 00:29:08.880
Uh, uh-huh.

443
00:29:10.912 --> 00:29:12.316
Wait, Mitsuha

444
00:29:22.332 --> 00:29:22.680
I...

445
00:29:23.884 --> 00:29:24.372
I...

446
00:29:25.596 --> 00:29:26.712
I did what ?

447
00:29:29.496 --> 00:29:30.468
Mitsuha ?

448
00:29:38.088 --> 00:29:38.800
Could this...

449
00:29:39.312 --> 00:29:40.352
Could this mean...

450
00:29:40.976 --> 00:29:42.480
No, No, No, No,

451
00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:43.752
Could this mean...

452
00:29:44.192 --> 00:29:45.040
That we're really

453
00:29:45.772 --> 00:29:48.332
That we're in our dreams,
That guy and I are...

454
00:29:48.512 --> 00:29:51.000
That we're in our dreams,
That girl and I are...

455
00:29:52.424 --> 00:29:53.712
We're switching places ?

456
00:30:08.712 --> 00:30:10.228
♪ At last, hello ♪

457
00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.248
♪ You've opened your eyes. ♪

458
00:30:13.172 --> 00:30:17.000
♪ But, why won't you even look me in the eyes,
what's wrong with you ?  ♪

459
00:30:18.884 --> 00:30:22.172
♪ You angrily tell me that I’m late ♪

460
00:30:23.428 --> 00:30:27.480
♪ Well, I'm sorry but I did my best
and running at my fastest pace ♪

461
00:30:28.152 --> 00:30:30.240
I'm slowly beginning to realize what's going on.

462
00:30:30.992 --> 00:30:33.240
Taki is high school and living in Tokyo

463
00:30:34.972 --> 00:30:38.480
Two or three time a week,
I'll suddenly and randomly switch with Mitsuha

464
00:30:38.712 --> 00:30:40.332
Who's somewhere out in the boonies

465
00:30:40.732 --> 00:30:42.156
The trigger is sleep..

466
00:30:42.352 --> 00:30:43.884
The cause is unknown.

467
00:30:44.668 --> 00:30:48.680
Any memory I have of the switch get
more and more hazy after I wake up.

468
00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:51.552
But there's no doubt that
we're switching places.

469
00:30:52.512 --> 00:30:54.776
The reactions of everyone around us prove it.

470
00:30:55.496 --> 00:30:56.228
That's why...

471
00:30:56.712 --> 00:31:01.000
That's why we decided to lay out some ground rules
so we can protect each other's way of life.

472
00:31:01.312 --> 00:31:01.600
No baths No looking
No touching

473
00:31:01.824 --> 00:31:03.716
Things to watch out during the switches

474
00:31:03.916 --> 00:31:05.640
And a list of stuff we should never do.

475
00:31:05.772 --> 00:31:06.352
Don't waste money. No dialect
Don't be late

476
00:31:06.752 --> 00:31:10.512
We also agreed to leave each other reports
on our phones on the days we switch places.

477
00:31:11.284 --> 00:31:14.712
So we can work together to get through
this weird thing that's happening.

478
00:31:16.312 --> 00:31:17.152
And yet...

479
00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:18.712
And yet...

480
00:31:19.552 --> 00:31:21.712
- I cannot believe this girl
- I cannot believe this guy

481
00:31:36.596 --> 00:31:37.736
Guys will stare.

482
00:31:37.884 --> 00:31:38.880
Watch the skirt,

483
00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.880
These are basics for a girl

484
00:31:44.512 --> 00:31:46.352
Stop wasting my money on sweets

485
00:31:46.352 --> 00:31:49.352
It's going in your body.
Plus, I also work for the money...

486
00:31:49.576 --> 00:31:51.112
Braiding cords is impossible

487
00:31:51.152 --> 00:31:53.000
You work way too many shifts

488
00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:54.680
Cause you keep wasting money

489
00:31:55.132 --> 00:31:58.684
♪ I wonder if we can push our way through ♪

490
00:31:59.456 --> 00:32:03.840
♪ The countless barrier that's waiting
in the future just beyond our view ♪

491
00:32:05.208 --> 00:32:08.628
♪ Side by side, no way we can lose ♪

492
00:32:09.648 --> 00:32:13.864
♪ We'll beat destiny at its own game
and make it follow our own rules ♪

493
00:32:15.196 --> 00:32:17.640
Had tea with Ms. Okudera on the way home

494
00:32:17.932 --> 00:32:19.480
You two have a good thing going

495
00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:22.648
Quit messing with my relationships, Mitsuha

496
00:32:23.129 --> 00:32:26.758
Hey Taki, why is a girl confessing her love to me ?

497
00:32:23.312 --> 00:32:26.800
Hey Taki, why is a girl confessing her love to me ?

498
00:32:26.912 --> 00:32:29.376
Maybe you're just more popular when I'm you.

499
00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.000
You're so full of yourself

500
00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.600
Like you have a girlfriend

501
00:32:32.612 --> 00:32:34.044
You don't have anyone either

502
00:32:34.064 --> 00:32:35.840
- I don't...
- I don't...

503
00:32:35.912 --> 00:32:38.000
Because I don't want a relationship

504
00:32:59.672 --> 00:33:01.064
I shouldn't for her sake.

505
00:33:05.528 --> 00:33:07.772
You sure do like your own boobies.

506
00:33:08.048 --> 00:33:09.268
Time to go

507
00:33:09.468 --> 00:33:10.596
Get ready

508
00:33:13.068 --> 00:33:17.068
Over the course of the last few days,
The Tiamat Comet has been visible.

509
00:33:17.392 --> 00:33:19.468
But when and where can people see it ?

510
00:33:20.072 --> 00:33:25.072
The Tiamat Comet will be moving in the same direction,
The sun does from east to west from our point of view.

511
00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:27.592
So right after sunset as for where it can seen...

512
00:33:27.624 --> 00:33:29.572
Why are you wearing your uniform ?

513
00:33:38.016 --> 00:33:38.840
Grandma,

514
00:33:39.064 --> 00:33:43.332
Why does our shrine's god relic
have to be kept so far away ?

515
00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:46.776
Cause of Mayugoro,
I don't really know.

516
00:33:46.884 --> 00:33:48.016
Who's Mayugoro ?

517
00:33:48.264 --> 00:33:50.284
What ?
He's famous

518
00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.516
Hop on, Grandma.

519
00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:06.712
Oh,
Watch out, careful.

520
00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.240
Mitsuha, Yotsuha,

521
00:34:20.268 --> 00:34:22.084
Do you know about "Musubi" ?

522
00:34:22.172 --> 00:34:23.256
Musubi ?

523
00:34:23.348 --> 00:34:29.048
It's what we used to call the local guardian
deity long ago and it means "Union".

524
00:34:29.152 --> 00:34:31.800
This word has profound meaning.

525
00:34:32.404 --> 00:34:35.000
Tying strings together is a union.

526
00:34:35.404 --> 00:34:37.828
Connecting to people is a union.

527
00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:40.684
And the flow of time is a union.

528
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.352
These are all part of the god's power.

529
00:34:44.512 --> 00:34:47.532
The braided cords that
we make are tied to that.

530
00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.664
A skill from the god.

531
00:34:49.732 --> 00:34:52.640
They represent the flow of time itself.

532
00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:56.480
They assemble and take shape.

533
00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:59.000
They twist, tangle

534
00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.932
Unravel now and then,

535
00:35:01.072 --> 00:35:03.532
break and reconnect.

536
00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:06.332
That's what a union is.

537
00:35:06.516 --> 00:35:07.972
What time is.

538
00:35:11.404 --> 00:35:12.336
Have a drink.

539
00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.192
Thanks.

540
00:35:14.688 --> 00:35:16.000
I want some too

541
00:35:16.124 --> 00:35:18.132
That's also a union.

542
00:35:19.792 --> 00:35:22.352
Whether it's water, rice or sake,

543
00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.064
When something becomes a part of a person,

544
00:35:25.136 --> 00:35:26.312
It's a union.

545
00:35:26.416 --> 00:35:28.248
It joins their soul.

546
00:35:28.428 --> 00:35:30.792
Which is why the offering
we're making today

547
00:35:30.824 --> 00:35:32.680
Is such an important custom.

548
00:35:33.168 --> 00:35:35.532
It connects the god with people.

549
00:35:38.064 --> 00:35:39.600
Hey, I can see it

550
00:35:43.296 --> 00:35:44.440
This is where it is.

551
00:35:44.696 --> 00:35:47.772
The secret relic of Miyamizu's Shrine.

552
00:36:04.592 --> 00:36:07.752
What lies ahead is the "here-after".

553
00:36:08.372 --> 00:36:10.192
It's the Netherworld.

554
00:36:11.932 --> 00:36:13.724
The Netherworld

555
00:36:16.024 --> 00:36:18.752
In order to return to this world,

556
00:36:18.932 --> 00:36:20.400
you have to leave behind,

557
00:36:20.572 --> 00:36:22.680
what is most important to you.

558
00:36:25.312 --> 00:36:28.312
Like the kuchikamisake.

559
00:36:28.532 --> 00:36:29.952
kuchikamisake ?

560
00:36:30.372 --> 00:36:33.684
You'll offer it at the
foot of the shrine god's relic.

561
00:36:34.312 --> 00:36:36.792
After all, it is half of you.

562
00:36:38.912 --> 00:36:41.428
Half of Mitsuha

563
00:36:59.068 --> 00:37:01.172
Wow, it's already magic hour

564
00:37:01.736 --> 00:37:02.952
Magic hour ?

565
00:37:13.972 --> 00:37:14.880
Oh yeah,

566
00:37:15.064 --> 00:37:16.712
Maybe I can see the comet.

567
00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:19.080
The comet ?

568
00:37:20.416 --> 00:37:21.000
Oh,

569
00:37:21.808 --> 00:37:22.772
Mitsuha,

570
00:37:23.624 --> 00:37:26.280
You're dreaming right now, aren't you ?

571
00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.172
I'm crying ?

572
00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:40.960
But why ?

573
00:37:43.008 --> 00:37:45.464
I'm almost there.
Looking forward to it.

574
00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.240
Ms. Okudera ?

575
00:37:48.192 --> 00:37:49.468
She's almost where ?

576
00:37:51.116 --> 00:37:52.776
Oh, Mitsuha what did you do

577
00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.172
Date ?

578
00:38:03.256 --> 00:38:05.712
Tomorrow is your
Tokyo date with Ms. Okudera

579
00:38:06.408 --> 00:38:08.684
Meet up at the station at 10:30

580
00:38:10.604 --> 00:38:13.192
Well that's what I had planned but...

581
00:38:27.316 --> 00:38:28.668
Hi Taki.

582
00:38:30.712 --> 00:38:31.428
Wait long ?

583
00:38:31.736 --> 00:38:32.312
Yeah.

584
00:38:33.064 --> 00:38:33.552
No...

585
00:38:43.972 --> 00:38:45.284
I just got here.

586
00:38:45.372 --> 00:38:46.352
Thank goodness.

587
00:38:46.884 --> 00:38:47.532
Let's go.

588
00:38:49.864 --> 00:38:51.096
Must be nice.

589
00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.592
They probably met up about now...

590
00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:58.080
Huh ?

591
00:39:02.332 --> 00:39:03.208
Why am I...

592
00:39:05.112 --> 00:39:05.932
Why ?

593
00:39:12.028 --> 00:39:12.628
Wow

594
00:39:12.632 --> 00:39:14.228
It was a date I wanted to go on,

595
00:39:14.972 --> 00:39:15.372
Look

596
00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.932
but if it so happens that you end up going,
Look over there

597
00:39:18.132 --> 00:39:20.172
You better be grateful and enjoy it.

598
00:39:20.552 --> 00:39:21.688
This is nice.

599
00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.000
It's my first time here

600
00:39:23.312 --> 00:39:25.088
So it is one of your usual go.

601
00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:27.892
At any rate, I bet you've never
even been out on a single date

602
00:39:27.912 --> 00:39:29.512
No way, it's too expensive.

603
00:39:31.284 --> 00:39:32.932
I don't know what to say to her..

604
00:39:33.272 --> 00:39:36.356
That's why I handpicked some
links below to help you out,

605
00:39:36.776 --> 00:39:37.936
You wildflower.

606
00:39:37.992 --> 00:39:38.572
For Real

607
00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:38.992
Hand picked links for Taki

608
00:39:39.576 --> 00:39:42.284
How to get a girlfriend even with
a communication disorder

609
00:39:42.416 --> 00:39:43.448
Conversation skills for the unpopular

610
00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.932
You won't make them sick anymore
A feature on text they will love

611
00:39:46.256 --> 00:39:48.000
She's making fun of me.

612
00:39:48.424 --> 00:39:54.440
"Photo exhibition: Nostalgia"

613
00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:18.732
You know something Taki ?

614
00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:23.248
Today, you're like a different person

615
00:40:32.732 --> 00:40:33.932
Um, Ms. Okudera.

616
00:40:34.532 --> 00:40:35.752
You getting hungry ?

617
00:40:36.224 --> 00:40:37.628
We could get dinner...

618
00:40:39.532 --> 00:40:40.912
Let's call it a day.

619
00:40:42.712 --> 00:40:43.448
Alright.

620
00:40:44.116 --> 00:40:45.280
I could be wrong...

621
00:40:45.912 --> 00:40:47.404
and I'm sorry if I am...

622
00:40:47.716 --> 00:40:48.280
About ?

623
00:40:48.696 --> 00:40:51.376
But you used to have
a little crush on me,

624
00:40:51.448 --> 00:40:52.172
Am I right ?

625
00:40:53.776 --> 00:40:54.680
But right now,

626
00:40:55.008 --> 00:40:56.552
there's someone else you like, huh ?

627
00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.448
What ?
No.

628
00:40:59.468 --> 00:41:00.632
No, It's not that...

629
00:41:00.628 --> 00:41:01.532
Really ?

630
00:41:01.992 --> 00:41:02.868
There's no one

631
00:41:03.208 --> 00:41:04.228
It's not like that.

632
00:41:04.312 --> 00:41:05.992
Are you sure about that ?

633
00:41:07.484 --> 00:41:09.284
Well, thanks for today.

634
00:41:09.896 --> 00:41:10.732
See you at work.

635
00:41:25.784 --> 00:41:27.448
By the time the date is over,

636
00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:30.468
You should be able to see
the comet in the sky.

637
00:41:34.152 --> 00:41:35.192
What does she mean ?

638
00:41:35.488 --> 00:41:36.204
Weirdo.

639
00:41:40.084 --> 00:41:43.228
"Mitsuha Miyamizu"

640
00:42:05.136 --> 00:42:07.176
Oh, it's you, Tessie.

641
00:42:08.336 --> 00:42:08.840
No,

642
00:42:09.336 --> 00:42:11.152
I just didn't feel like going, that's all.

643
00:42:11.648 --> 00:42:12.312
I'm fine.

644
00:42:13.572 --> 00:42:14.000
What ?

645
00:42:14.756 --> 00:42:15.572
The festival ?

646
00:42:16.692 --> 00:42:19.664
Oh yeah, the comet

647
00:42:20.284 --> 00:42:22.176
It'll be at its brightest today right ?

648
00:42:23.732 --> 00:42:24.840
Ok, got it.

649
00:42:25.608 --> 00:42:26.392
See you later

650
00:42:30.152 --> 00:42:33.512
You're just looking forward to see
Mitsuha in a yukata, aren't ya ?

651
00:42:33.792 --> 00:42:34.912
I- I am not

652
00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:37.448
It didn't even cross my mind..

653
00:42:38.472 --> 00:42:39.080
You know,

654
00:42:39.372 --> 00:42:41.496
she sounded kind of down
when I talked to her...

655
00:42:41.516 --> 00:42:43.784
Maybe she just didn't
want a call from you.

656
00:42:43.828 --> 00:42:45.064
It's not funny

657
00:42:45.112 --> 00:42:46.064
Sorry to keep you.

658
00:42:46.148 --> 00:42:47.132
- Oh, she's here
- You're late

659
00:42:50.132 --> 00:42:52.376
Mitsuha what happened to...

660
00:42:54.284 --> 00:42:55.312
Your hair

661
00:42:56.156 --> 00:42:58.596
I guess, it's weird.

662
00:43:07.848 --> 00:43:09.752
You think it's gotta do with some guy ?

663
00:43:09.816 --> 00:43:11.132
Like, he broke her heart ?

664
00:43:11.156 --> 00:43:14.208
Guys always just assume that
it has to do with a boy.

665
00:43:14.592 --> 00:43:16.572
She said she felt like cutting it.

666
00:43:16.712 --> 00:43:17.896
You sure about that ?

667
00:43:17.912 --> 00:43:20.376
You really think she felt like
cutting off that much of it ?

668
00:43:20.792 --> 00:43:21.192
Oh

669
00:43:21.544 --> 00:43:23.428
Hey guys I can see it

670
00:43:41.932 --> 00:43:42.840
Whoa

671
00:44:02.224 --> 00:44:07.480
The number you are trying to reach is currently outside
the cellular network or has been turned off...

672
00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:14.000
I'll just have to tell her how lousy the date was
the next time we switch.

673
00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:16.400
That's what I thought...

674
00:44:17.712 --> 00:44:18.172
But...

675
00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:20.000
For some reason,

676
00:44:20.448 --> 00:44:23.312
The switches Mitsuha and I have
been going through until now,

677
00:44:24.692 --> 00:44:26.112
They never happened again...

678
00:45:01.132 --> 00:45:04.112
"Mountains in Gifu Prefecture"

679
00:45:14.912 --> 00:45:16.512
"Hida mountains"

680
00:46:19.312 --> 00:46:21.480
What- What are...

681
00:46:21.992 --> 00:46:23.352
What are you doing here ?

682
00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:29.112
Tsukasa told me about it so here I am

683
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.576
I asked for two things.

684
00:46:34.888 --> 00:46:38.016
To cover my shift and to back up
my alibi if my dad asked.

685
00:46:38.112 --> 00:46:40.000
Relax, Takagi is gonna take your shift.

686
00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:41.200
Gotcha covered.

687
00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:42.532
But you owe me dinner

688
00:46:43.576 --> 00:46:44.912
So you are all in on it.

689
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.392
- You got everyone worried about you.
- Huh ?

690
00:46:47.684 --> 00:46:50.752
We can't ignore this. What if someone
is trying to pull one over on you ?

691
00:46:50.772 --> 00:46:51.772
Like catfish ?

692
00:46:52.072 --> 00:46:54.416
I mean you met this person online,
Didn't you ?

693
00:46:54.424 --> 00:46:55.484
No, not exactly...

694
00:46:55.528 --> 00:46:56.824
It's kind of complicated...

695
00:46:56.864 --> 00:46:58.772
- Could be from a dating site.
- She's not

696
00:46:59.792 --> 00:47:02.112
It's because you've been
acting awfully fishy lately.

697
00:47:02.172 --> 00:47:03.640
So we're keeping an eye on you.

698
00:47:03.668 --> 00:47:05.440
I don't need a babysitter okay ?

699
00:47:07.824 --> 00:47:09.112
The switches stopped.

700
00:47:09.868 --> 00:47:12.868
My calls never connected.
And texts never went through.

701
00:47:13.192 --> 00:47:15.732
That's why I decided to go
see Mitsuha in person.

702
00:47:17.808 --> 00:47:19.000
I wanted to see her.

703
00:47:19.776 --> 00:47:21.400
But...

704
00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:23.248
What ?

705
00:47:23.408 --> 00:47:25.240
You don't know where she is exactly ?

706
00:47:25.448 --> 00:47:27.592
The town's landscape is your only clue ?

707
00:47:27.972 --> 00:47:28.884
Yeah.

708
00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:33.440
And you can't contact her ?

709
00:47:33.864 --> 00:47:35.040
What's that about ?

710
00:47:35.756 --> 00:47:36.556
Where are we ?

711
00:47:36.772 --> 00:47:38.912
- You're a terrible tour guide.
- Cause I'm not one ?

712
00:47:39.648 --> 00:47:40.516
Oh well.

713
00:47:40.912 --> 00:47:42.468
Guess we'll help you search.

714
00:47:42.668 --> 00:47:44.312
Oh it's so cute

715
00:47:44.448 --> 00:47:45.116
Look Taki

716
00:47:45.972 --> 00:47:47.312
Seriously guys ?

717
00:47:47.372 --> 00:47:49.376
It moved
Oh

718
00:48:18.232 --> 00:48:19.440
This is a lost cause...

719
00:48:19.552 --> 00:48:20.468
What ?

720
00:48:20.616 --> 00:48:23.372
After everything that
we've done for you today ?

721
00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:27.880
You haven't done anything.

722
00:48:31.928 --> 00:48:33.080
One Takayama ramen.

723
00:48:33.504 --> 00:48:34.512
One Takayama ramen.

724
00:48:35.096 --> 00:48:36.196
I guess I'll have the same.

725
00:48:36.612 --> 00:48:37.248
Sure.

726
00:48:37.896 --> 00:48:39.132
3 orders of ramen

727
00:48:39.324 --> 00:48:39.880
Got it.

728
00:48:42.204 --> 00:48:44.176
Think we can make it back to Tokyo tonight ?

729
00:48:44.196 --> 00:48:46.440
We'll I think we would be cutting it close.

730
00:48:46.472 --> 00:48:47.312
Let me take a look

731
00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:48.428
Okay thanks.

732
00:48:48.432 --> 00:48:49.480
Wait, Taki.

733
00:48:49.512 --> 00:48:50.572
You sure about that ?

734
00:48:53.068 --> 00:48:53.576
Yeah.

735
00:48:53.712 --> 00:48:57.392
I kinda feel like maybe I've been barking
up the wrong tree this whole time.

736
00:49:02.068 --> 00:49:04.624
Hey, that's a sketch of Itomori, isn't it ?

737
00:49:06.932 --> 00:49:08.000
It's drawn really well.

738
00:49:08.752 --> 00:49:10.208
Come take a look at this Hun

739
00:49:11.932 --> 00:49:13.572
Yeah, it's Itomori.

740
00:49:13.868 --> 00:49:15.028
It takes me back.

741
00:49:15.064 --> 00:49:17.400
My husband was born and
raised there you know.

742
00:49:17.856 --> 00:49:18.792
Itomori... ?

743
00:49:21.112 --> 00:49:22.196
Yes of course

744
00:49:22.588 --> 00:49:23.532
That's the place

745
00:49:23.868 --> 00:49:25.196
It's nearby, right ?

746
00:49:25.868 --> 00:49:26.868
You don't...

747
00:49:27.116 --> 00:49:28.680
Itomori was...

748
00:49:29.088 --> 00:49:30.000
Itomori ?

749
00:49:31.048 --> 00:49:31.757
- Wait
- That's where

750
00:49:31.984 --> 00:49:33.792
Is it that the area where that comet... ?

751
00:49:42.408 --> 00:49:47.400
"Keep Out"

752
00:50:24.068 --> 00:50:24.792
Hey.

753
00:50:25.264 --> 00:50:27.280
Is this place really where she's from ?

754
00:50:27.432 --> 00:50:28.000
No way

755
00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:30.824
Taki must have just confused
this with somewhere else.

756
00:50:31.248 --> 00:50:32.064
No I didn't.

757
00:50:33.248 --> 00:50:34.532
This was the place.

758
00:50:35.228 --> 00:50:36.440
This schoolyard.

759
00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:37.668
These mountains.

760
00:50:37.712 --> 00:50:39.112
Even this high school here

761
00:50:39.248 --> 00:50:40.592
I remember it all

762
00:50:40.776 --> 00:50:42.280
There's no way you could.

763
00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:45.880
You've got to know about that
disaster three years ago right ?

764
00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:48.372
Hundreds of people died ?

765
00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:49.192
They died ?

766
00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:52.132
3 years ago ?

767
00:50:53.132 --> 00:50:53.976
It can't be.

768
00:50:56.284 --> 00:50:57.192
There's no way.

769
00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:58.592
I mean...

770
00:51:19.228 --> 00:51:20.084
They're fading...

771
00:51:30.956 --> 00:51:35.000
Comet Tiamat, with an
orbital period of 1,200 years,

772
00:51:34.992 --> 00:51:35.352
"Itomori, the Town that Vanished"

773
00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:38.428
made a close approach to Earth
3 years ago in October.

774
00:51:38.772 --> 00:51:39.400
"Meteor Strikes,
Wipes out Town"

775
00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:43.000
Nobody foresaw that its nucleus
would split at its perigee.

776
00:51:43.428 --> 00:51:45.000
"Town Annihilated"

777
00:51:45.296 --> 00:51:46.712
"Over 500 dead or missing"

778
00:51:46.848 --> 00:51:48.268
"Itomori, the Town that Vanished"

779
00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:53.376
A fragment that broke off of it
became a meteor and struck Japan.

780
00:51:53.552 --> 00:51:55.224
"Itomori, comet damage"

781
00:51:55.784 --> 00:51:59.112
It looks like that day was the
same day as the autumn festival.

782
00:52:00.268 --> 00:52:01.668
The point of impact was here.

783
00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:07.000
At 8:42 p.m., it fell right around where
people were gathered for the festival.

784
00:52:10.372 --> 00:52:11.132
"List of the Names of Victims"

785
00:52:12.132 --> 00:52:13.772
Over 500 died,

786
00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:16.316
It was a third of the town's population,

787
00:52:16.884 --> 00:52:18.912
And now nobody lives in Itomori anymore.

788
00:52:28.332 --> 00:52:30.972
Teshigawara and Sayaka

789
00:52:32.921 --> 00:52:36.559
"Mitsuha Miyamizu"

790
00:52:36.592 --> 00:52:37.352
That's her ?

791
00:52:37.736 --> 00:52:38.680
You were wrong.

792
00:52:38.792 --> 00:52:39.892
You gotta be

793
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.880
After all, this girl here died 3 years ago

794
00:52:43.772 --> 00:52:48.000
Just 2 or 3 weeks ago, she said
that I'd be able to see the comet.

795
00:52:48.912 --> 00:52:49.640
That means...

796
00:52:50.756 --> 00:52:52.840
You're dreaming right now...

797
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:53.480
I...

798
00:52:53.572 --> 00:52:54.196
...aren't you ?

799
00:52:56.484 --> 00:52:57.064
I...

800
00:52:59.684 --> 00:53:01.280
What was I... ?

801
00:53:15.132 --> 00:53:16.468
Sounds lively over there.

802
00:53:17.048 --> 00:53:18.516
They only have one room left.

803
00:53:18.772 --> 00:53:19.792
I'm really sorry.

804
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.152
It's not a problem.

805
00:53:22.428 --> 00:53:23.312
How's Taki ?

806
00:53:23.576 --> 00:53:26.000
He's still reading articles on Itomori.

807
00:53:26.332 --> 00:53:29.000
He's going through all those
newspapers and magazines at random.

808
00:53:29.064 --> 00:53:30.000
Seems obsessive.

809
00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:36.112
What is it ?

810
00:53:36.356 --> 00:53:37.152
Oh, sorry.

811
00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.152
You smoke huh ?

812
00:53:38.752 --> 00:53:39.312
Yeah.

813
00:53:39.912 --> 00:53:41.480
I did quit at one point...

814
00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:45.240
- What do you think about
- What Taki's been saying ?

815
00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:50.132
I had feelings for him.

816
00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:50.732
You know ?

817
00:53:51.608 --> 00:53:53.084
The way he's been recently...

818
00:53:53.848 --> 00:53:57.408
I mean he was a nice guy before,
but he's even nicer now.

819
00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.312
Kind of frantic.

820
00:54:00.772 --> 00:54:01.752
It was cute.

821
00:54:02.848 --> 00:54:06.772
Although I do think what he's been telling
us is definitely strange sounding.

822
00:54:09.376 --> 00:54:12.248
In the end, the fact remains that
Taki has met someone.

823
00:54:12.272 --> 00:54:14.332
And that someone is the reason he changed.

824
00:54:16.896 --> 00:54:17.376
That much is for sure.

"Worst-ever Itomori Comet Disaster"

826
00:54:33.248 --> 00:54:34.468
It was all just a dream.

827
00:54:36.732 --> 00:54:38.064
I recognized the landscape because

828
00:54:38.556 --> 00:54:41.372
I unconsciously remember
the news from 3 years ago.

829
00:54:43.992 --> 00:54:46.600
If is not that,
is she a ghost ?

830
00:54:47.336 --> 00:54:47.772
Or...

831
00:54:48.936 --> 00:54:51.640
- Did I just make it up ?
- The whole thing ?

832
00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:58.172
What was her name ?

833
00:54:58.372 --> 00:54:59.240
I don't remember.

834
00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:04.572
Tsukasa said he was go
ahead and take a bath.

835
00:55:04.712 --> 00:55:06.000
Ms. Okudera.

836
00:55:07.756 --> 00:55:08.512
I, uh...

837
00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:11.752
I realize I've been saying
a lot of strange things.

838
00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:14.440
I'm really sorry and thank you.

"Braided Cords of Itomori"

841
00:55:23.428 --> 00:55:25.440
- Braided cords.
- Pretty.

842
00:55:26.668 --> 00:55:28.064
That band on you wrist...

843
00:55:28.596 --> 00:55:29.512
That's one isn't it ?

844
00:55:30.696 --> 00:55:32.028
Oh, this thing ?

845
00:55:32.176 --> 00:55:32.716
I guess so.

846
00:55:33.248 --> 00:55:36.136
Somebody... Someone gave it to me.

847
00:55:37.064 --> 00:55:39.608
I wear it sometimes as
kind of a lucky charm...

848
00:55:42.648 --> 00:55:43.640
Who was it ?

849
00:55:46.224 --> 00:55:46.976
It's late.

850
00:55:47.336 --> 00:55:49.268
Why don't you go down
and take a bath, too ?

851
00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:49.932
Sure.

852
00:55:50.468 --> 00:55:51.000
Wait.

853
00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:54.840
Yeah.

854
00:55:55.476 --> 00:55:56.848
Someone who makes these...

855
00:55:57.196 --> 00:55:58.600
They once told me something.

856
00:55:59.112 --> 00:56:01.400
The cords represent the flow of time.

857
00:56:02.112 --> 00:56:05.172
They twist and tangle,
unravel and connect.

858
00:56:05.752 --> 00:56:07.828
And that's what time is...

859
00:56:10.408 --> 00:56:11.372
Maybe if I could..

860
00:56:29.592 --> 00:56:31.064
"Around here ?"

861
00:56:37.856 --> 00:56:38.480

Taki.

863
00:56:41.752 --> 00:56:42.772
Taki.

864
00:56:44.756 --> 00:56:45.884
Don't you remember ?

865
00:57:00.972 --> 00:57:01.880
I have to go somewhere.

866
00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:03.480
Return to Tokyo without me.

867
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:04.840
I'll return later.

868
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:05.840
Thanks.

869
00:57:09.196 --> 00:57:10.000
Taki..

870
00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:36.064
Eat this bento up there.

871
00:57:37.776 --> 00:57:39.240
Your drawing of Itomori...

872
00:57:40.312 --> 00:57:41.680
You did a real good job.

They assemble and take shape.

874
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:23.264
They twist, tangle,

875
00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:24.792
Unravel now and then,

876
00:58:25.376 --> 00:58:27.040
break and reconnect...

877
00:58:28.684 --> 00:58:29.956
That's what a union is.

878
00:58:30.572 --> 00:58:31.840
What time is.

879
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:44.772
There it is

880
00:58:47.552 --> 00:58:48.480
It's really there

881
00:58:49.712 --> 00:58:51.868
It wasn't a dream

882
00:59:23.152 --> 00:59:26.440
What lies ahead is the Netherworld.

883
00:59:49.536 --> 00:59:50.532
It's still here.

884
00:59:52.864 --> 00:59:54.468
This is was Yotsuha's,

885
00:59:55.384 --> 00:59:56.576
and this was mine.

886
00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.040
This was before the comet...

887
01:00:01.776 --> 01:00:03.592
So when I switched places with her,

888
01:00:04.316 --> 01:00:06.172
It was also 3 years in the past.

889
01:00:08.264 --> 01:00:11.176
Our times got tangled somehow.

890
01:00:12.864 --> 01:00:14.536
This is half of her...

891
01:00:29.924 --> 01:00:30.664
Musubi.

892
01:00:32.192 --> 01:00:34.800
If it's true, and time can be unraveled..

893
01:00:36.064 --> 01:00:37.808
Just give me one more chance...

894
01:00:52.732 --> 01:00:54.000
A comet

895
01:01:59.112 --> 01:02:01.808
Your name is going to be Mitsuha.

896
01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.428
Both of you are my treasures.

897
01:02:11.112 --> 01:02:13.152
You're going to be a big sister.

898
01:02:13.404 --> 01:02:15.732
"Get well soon, Mom."

899
01:02:16.024 --> 01:02:18.440
I'm so sorry my dears.

900
01:02:20.732 --> 01:02:23.372
Dad, when is Mommy coming home ?

901
01:02:24.772 --> 01:02:26.240
I couldn't help her.

902
01:02:26.332 --> 01:02:28.000
Get a hold of yourself

903
01:02:28.064 --> 01:02:29.640
Who cares about the shrine ?

904
01:02:29.696 --> 01:02:31.332
But you're in charge now

905
01:02:31.336 --> 01:02:33.796
I loved Futaba.
Not Miyamizu Shrine

906
01:02:33.808 --> 01:02:34.772
Get out

907
01:02:38.532 --> 01:02:40.532
Now listen to me girls,

908
01:02:40.668 --> 01:02:43.592
Starting today,
you'll be living with Grandma.

909
01:02:49.316 --> 01:02:50.172
Who am I ?

910
01:02:50.424 --> 01:02:51.552
Who are you ?

911
01:02:51.912 --> 01:02:53.280
Don't be full of yourself.

912
01:02:53.428 --> 01:02:55.000
Like you have a girlfriend.

913
01:02:55.532 --> 01:02:56.600
Must be nice...

914
01:02:56.932 --> 01:02:58.600
They probably met up about now...

915
01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:01.480
Why am I...

916
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:02.864
I'm going to Tokyo.

917
01:03:02.972 --> 01:03:04.952
What ?
Wait, Sis

918
01:03:07.792 --> 01:03:08.372
Grandma ?

919
01:03:09.228 --> 01:03:10.880
Would you mind doing me a favor ?

920
01:03:12.208 --> 01:03:13.280
Oh yeah, the comet.

921
01:03:15.296 --> 01:03:16.932
It'll be at its brightest today right ?

922
01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:20.176
Mitsuha Don't go there

923
01:03:21.312 --> 01:03:22.040
Mitsuha,

924
01:03:22.712 --> 01:03:25.372
You've got to get out of town
before the comet strikes

925
01:03:28.192 --> 01:03:29.512
Mitsuha, run

926
01:03:30.696 --> 01:03:31.376
Mitsuha

927
01:03:31.992 --> 01:03:32.732
Mitsuha

928
01:03:33.532 --> 01:03:35.640
Mitsuha

929
01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:54.592
Mitsuha

930
01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:56.392
She's alive

931
01:04:07.628 --> 01:04:09.532
Let me guess, you're touching your boobs...

932
01:04:12.572 --> 01:04:13.828
My sister

933
01:04:16.248 --> 01:04:18.440
Yotsuha

934
01:04:21.808 --> 01:04:23.972
I think she's finally lost it.

935
01:04:24.352 --> 01:04:27.392
Just for today,
I'm gonna head out first.

936
01:04:27.624 --> 01:04:28.608
She's lost it.

937
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:29.992
Really lost it.

938
01:04:30.972 --> 01:04:32.008
Totally.

939
01:04:32.716 --> 01:04:34.468
For all you star gazers out there,

940
01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:38.132
The Comet Tiamat has been visible
to the naked eye for about a week now.

941
01:04:38.512 --> 01:04:42.084
Tonight it will finally reach
its perigee around 7:40 p.m.,

942
01:04:42.532 --> 01:04:44.892
and be at its maximum brightness
when viewed from the Earth's surface.

943
01:04:44.896 --> 01:04:47.112
It's tonight.
There's still time left.

944
01:04:48.424 --> 01:04:49.840
Morning, Mitsuha.

945
01:04:50.524 --> 01:04:51.352
What's this ?

946
01:04:52.312 --> 01:04:55.480
Hold on, you're not Mitsuha,
Are you ?

947
01:04:56.112 --> 01:04:57.372
Wait... How did you ?

948
01:04:58.316 --> 01:04:59.572
You already knew ?

949
01:05:00.268 --> 01:05:00.932
No,

950
01:05:01.372 --> 01:05:05.752
But watching the way you've been
behaving lately stirred some memories.

951
01:05:07.628 --> 01:05:09.372
When I was a young girl,

952
01:05:10.008 --> 01:05:12.592
I had some pretty strange dreams myself.

953
01:05:13.912 --> 01:05:19.972
Though it's been so long, the memories of who I became
in those dreams have pretty much faded at this point.

954
01:05:20.772 --> 01:05:21.752
Faded...

955
01:05:22.112 --> 01:05:26.592
Treasure the experience.
Dreams eventually will fade away.

956
01:05:27.372 --> 01:05:30.000
I went through similar times myself

957
01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:31.752
And so did your mother.

958
01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:33.972
What if...

959
01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:36.756
All of those dreams of the
Miyamizu people had ?

960
01:05:37.608 --> 01:05:38.912
It had to do with today.

961
01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:42.372
Grandma, you have to listen to me.

962
01:05:43.356 --> 01:05:46.936
Tonight, the comet is going to fall on Itomori.

963
01:05:47.112 --> 01:05:48.280
You're all going to die

964
01:05:55.592 --> 01:05:56.840
"Nobody is gonna believe that" ?

965
01:05:57.512 --> 01:05:59.712
I didn't expect that out of
Mitsuha's grandma.

966
01:06:00.424 --> 01:06:01.312
It doesn't matter.

967
01:06:01.592 --> 01:06:04.372
There's no way,
I'm gonna let them all die

968
01:06:04.928 --> 01:06:05.552
Mitsuha

969
01:06:06.312 --> 01:06:07.428
What happened ?

970
01:06:07.484 --> 01:06:08.016
To...

971
01:06:09.284 --> 01:06:09.972
What'd you...

972
01:06:10.712 --> 01:06:11.576
Your hair

973
01:06:11.696 --> 01:06:12.800
Oh, the haircut ?

974
01:06:13.084 --> 01:06:14.284
It looked better before, huh ?

975
01:06:14.312 --> 01:06:16.040
No, it's good

976
01:06:16.152 --> 01:06:19.732
Never mind that If we don't do
something about tonight, we'll all die

977
01:06:22.536 --> 01:06:25.468
It's up to us to save everyone

978
01:06:29.264 --> 01:06:31.312
Wait, shouldn't you be in school ?

979
01:06:31.512 --> 01:06:35.568
Well, we sort of have to save
the town or something

980
01:06:37.932 --> 01:06:38.932
The warning system ?

981
01:06:39.084 --> 01:06:40.680
Yeah, those speakers all over town.

982
01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:44.840
"Superimposition frequency"

983
01:06:46.268 --> 01:06:46.840
I get it.

984
01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:47.880
It could work

985
01:06:48.392 --> 01:06:50.192
Nice job, Tessie

986
01:06:50.196 --> 01:06:52.712
Hey I don't think you should
be sitting so close to me

987
01:06:52.732 --> 01:06:53.376
What's wrong ?

988
01:06:53.468 --> 01:06:55.040
Uh-oh You shy ?

989
01:06:55.112 --> 01:06:55.912
Would you quit it ?

990
01:06:56.284 --> 01:06:57.932
It ain't proper and you know it.

991
01:06:58.468 --> 01:07:00.868
"Club Discontinued - Keep Out"

992
01:07:02.008 --> 01:07:03.312
Such a gentleman

993
01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:05.440
Since when

994
01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:07.732
I got all the snacks guys.

995
01:07:08.132 --> 01:07:09.732
- Here's the change.
- Sorry for the trouble.

996
01:07:10.664 --> 01:07:11.240
It's all right.

997
01:07:11.776 --> 01:07:14.084
- We ought to be getting paid.
- Quit complaining.

998
01:07:15.664 --> 01:07:16.280
So ?

999
01:07:16.468 --> 01:07:17.372
What'd you come up with ?

1000
01:07:17.932 --> 01:07:19.228
Got an evacuation plan ?

1001
01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:25.640
A... A bomb ?

1002
01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:30.440
Yeah, we have water gel explosives
we use for construction at our storage site.

1003
01:07:30.512 --> 01:07:31.868
And the warning system ?

1004
01:07:33.684 --> 01:07:37.248
The startup frequency can hijack
the town's warning system pretty easily.

1005
01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:40.972
So we can broadcast an evacuation warning
for the whole town right from school.

1006
01:07:41.484 --> 01:07:43.572
Look, we're outside the disaster area here,

1007
01:07:43.808 --> 01:07:46.280
So we'll just make an announcement
to evacuate to the school.

1008
01:07:46.628 --> 01:07:49.372
It's... It's totally a crime

1009
01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:51.080
You'll be in charge of the broadcast, Saya.

1010
01:07:51.096 --> 01:07:53.352
- Why me ?
- You're in the broadcast club.

1011
01:07:53.628 --> 01:07:55.392
And I'll be in charge of the explosives.

1012
01:07:55.532 --> 01:07:57.848
- While I'll go have a word with the mayor.
- Why ?

1013
01:07:57.848 --> 01:08:02.280
Cause if the evacuation order is not coming from
Town Hall, then nobody is gonna go anywhere.

1014
01:08:02.284 --> 01:08:05.240
But if I talk to the mayor as his daughter,
I can convince him.

1015
01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:06.880
It's a perfect plan.

1016
01:08:08.736 --> 01:08:10.972
Fine.
I don't really care one way or the other.

1017
01:08:11.572 --> 01:08:13.284
This is just a theory of yours, right ?

1018
01:08:13.776 --> 01:08:15.684
What ?
Well...

1019
01:08:15.972 --> 01:08:17.480
Theories can be based on reality.

1020
01:08:17.532 --> 01:08:20.132
Like do you know the story of
how Itomori Lake was formed ?

1021
01:08:20.152 --> 01:08:20.372
"A meteor crater lake
formed 1,200 years ago."

1022
01:08:20.624 --> 01:08:25.376
It's crater. That means a meteor hit
this area once at a thousand years ago

1023
01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:26.352
Right.

1024
01:08:26.932 --> 01:08:27.572
That's why...

1025
01:08:28.172 --> 01:08:29.532
Nice one, Tessie

1026
01:08:33.752 --> 01:08:35.484
Let's go evacuate the town

1027
01:08:39.808 --> 01:08:41.712
What on earth are you talking about ?

1028
01:08:43.796 --> 01:08:44.868
Like I said,

1029
01:08:45.112 --> 01:08:47.732
We have to evacuate everyone
in town before tonight or...

1030
01:08:47.736 --> 01:08:49.040
Enough, shut up.

1031
01:08:54.712 --> 01:08:57.628
The comet is gonna split in
two and strike the town ?

1032
01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:58.512
"Itomori Town Hall"

1033
01:08:58.576 --> 01:09:00.468
Over 500 will die ?

1034
01:09:01.312 --> 01:09:04.192
How dare you stand there
and spout such nonsense ?

1035
01:09:05.268 --> 01:09:07.448
If you're serious, you must be sick.

1036
01:09:08.152 --> 01:09:10.932
I guess recklessness is a Miyamizu trait.

1037
01:09:12.932 --> 01:09:16.080
I'll have a car take you to the
city hospital for an examination.

1038
01:09:16.536 --> 01:09:19.680
We will continue this discussion
after you've seen a doctor.

1039
01:09:22.064 --> 01:09:22.840
You..

1040
01:09:24.512 --> 01:09:25.752
You son of a...

1041
01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:35.312
Mitsuha

1042
01:09:37.052 --> 01:09:37.840
No...

1043
01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:39.880
Wait a minute...

1044
01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:42.512
Who are you ?

1045
01:09:58.152 --> 01:09:59.588
I'll see you guys at the festival.

1046
01:09:59.592 --> 01:10:01.008
We'll meet at the steps of the shrine.

1047
01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.680
- Don't be late okay ?
- Bye-bye

1048
01:10:02.732 --> 01:10:04.080
- See you.
- Later.

1049
01:10:06.176 --> 01:10:07.040
You shouldn't go

1050
01:10:07.828 --> 01:10:10.440
You've got to leave town.
Tell all of your friends.

1051
01:10:10.532 --> 01:10:11.592
What's wrong with you ?

1052
01:10:11.976 --> 01:10:13.064
Mitsuha

1053
01:10:13.068 --> 01:10:14.840
- What was that about ?
- Come on, let's go.

1054
01:10:15.428 --> 01:10:16.532
What are you doing ?

1055
01:10:18.196 --> 01:10:19.316
If it was Mitsuha...

1056
01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:22.040
Would she have been
able to convince them ?

1057
01:10:22.392 --> 01:10:23.448
Is all this my fault ?

1058
01:10:24.312 --> 01:10:27.732
Yotsuha, promise me that you'll leave
town with Grandma before dark.

1059
01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:28.484
What ?

1060
01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:30.332
You're gonna die if you stay here

1061
01:10:30.376 --> 01:10:31.628
What are you talking about ?

1062
01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:34.280
And why did you suddenly
go to Tokyo yesterday ?

1063
01:10:34.336 --> 01:10:36.792
You've been acting really strange lately

1064
01:10:38.468 --> 01:10:39.572
I went to Tokyo ?

1065
01:10:39.888 --> 01:10:42.064
Hey, Mitsuha

1066
01:10:44.824 --> 01:10:46.000
How did it go with your old man ?

1067
01:10:48.932 --> 01:10:50.372
Hey, Mitsuha ?

1068
01:10:51.424 --> 01:10:52.552
What's with your sister ?

1069
01:10:52.952 --> 01:10:53.792
Don't know.

1070
01:11:04.208 --> 01:11:05.800
Could she be over there ?

1071
01:11:06.824 --> 01:11:07.376
What's that ?

1072
01:11:07.684 --> 01:11:08.552
What's over there ?

1073
01:11:09.352 --> 01:11:10.448
Let me use your bike Tessie.

1074
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Hey, Mitsuha

1075
01:11:14.496 --> 01:11:15.576
And what do we do ?

1076
01:11:16.192 --> 01:11:17.680
Get things ready like we planned

1077
01:11:18.312 --> 01:11:19.840
I'm counting on you

1078
01:11:46.512 --> 01:11:47.136
Oh my gosh,

1079
01:11:47.396 --> 01:11:48.488
I'm Taki again.

1080
01:11:51.668 --> 01:11:53.752
But what was Taki doing out here ?

1081
01:12:03.868 --> 01:12:04.592
The town...

1082
01:12:05.576 --> 01:12:07.828
It's gone.

1083
01:12:16.848 --> 01:12:17.440
So...

1084
01:12:18.532 --> 01:12:19.668
Does that mean...

1085
01:12:22.428 --> 01:12:23.848
I died ?

1086
01:12:34.912 --> 01:12:35.668
Taki.

1087
01:12:36.824 --> 01:12:37.552
Taki.

1088
01:12:40.248 --> 01:12:41.592
Don't you remember ?

1089
01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:56.408
I'm going to Tokyo for a few hours.

1090
01:12:56.648 --> 01:12:57.172
What ?

1091
01:12:57.356 --> 01:12:58.116
Right now ?

1092
01:12:58.512 --> 01:12:59.080
But why ?

1093
01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:00.840
For a date.

1094
01:13:01.332 --> 01:13:03.132
You have a boyfriend in Tokyo ?

1095
01:13:03.152 --> 01:13:04.932
I didn't say it was a date for me.

1096
01:13:06.732 --> 01:13:07.840
I'll be back tonight.

1097
01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:12.888
If I suddenly show up,

1098
01:13:13.512 --> 01:13:14.684
Will it be a nuisance ?

1099
01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:16.288
Or a surprise ?

1100
01:13:17.116 --> 01:13:18.732
He might not like it if I do.

1101
01:13:27.132 --> 01:13:30.888
The number you are trying to reach is
currently outside the cellular network...

1102
01:13:31.448 --> 01:13:32.868
I guess it won't happen.

1103
01:13:33.796 --> 01:13:35.648
But what if it did ?

1104
01:13:36.716 --> 01:13:37.668
What would I do ?

1105
01:13:38.736 --> 01:13:39.732
Would I annoy him ?

1106
01:13:40.756 --> 01:13:41.668
Would it be awkward ?

1107
01:13:41.732 --> 01:13:42.576
"Tiamat Makes Closest Approach Tomorrow"

1108
01:13:42.776 --> 01:13:43.792
Or maybe...

1109
01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:46.448
He'd be glad to see me ?

1110
01:13:48.428 --> 01:13:52.152
The number you are trying to reach is
currently outside the cellular network...

1111
01:13:53.336 --> 01:13:54.992
I guess we won't meet.

1112
01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:57.552
But...

1113
01:13:58.952 --> 01:14:00.732
There's one thing I'm certain of.

1114
01:14:02.468 --> 01:14:03.840
If we see each other,

1115
01:14:04.608 --> 01:14:06.440
We'll definately know right away.

1116
01:14:08.224 --> 01:14:10.284
That you were the one who was in me.

1117
01:14:11.664 --> 01:14:15.268
And I was the one who was in you.

1118
01:14:15.332 --> 01:14:16.268
Sorry.

1119
01:14:48.008 --> 01:14:48.712
Excuse me.

1120
01:15:21.576 --> 01:15:23.448
That time 3 years ago,

1121
01:15:24.392 --> 01:15:25.684
Before I even knew you.

1122
01:15:29.756 --> 01:15:30.312
Taki.

1123
01:15:32.088 --> 01:15:32.732
Taki.

1124
01:15:34.884 --> 01:15:35.592
Taki.

1125
01:15:38.428 --> 01:15:39.132
Um... It's me.

1126
01:15:41.844 --> 01:15:43.880
So you remember ?

1127
01:15:45.112 --> 01:15:46.732
Sorry.
Who are you ?

1128
01:15:51.648 --> 01:15:52.800
I'm sorry.

1129
01:16:00.792 --> 01:16:01.976
But he's Taki.

1130
01:16:03.776 --> 01:16:04.884
What a weird girl.

1131
01:16:14.152 --> 01:16:14.864
Hold on

1132
01:16:16.392 --> 01:16:17.376
What's your name ?

1133
01:16:18.552 --> 01:16:19.284
Mitsuha

1134
01:16:20.196 --> 01:16:22.316
My name is Mitsuha

1135
01:16:29.192 --> 01:16:30.024
3 years ago,

1136
01:16:31.448 --> 01:16:32.172
You showed up...

1137
01:16:33.372 --> 01:16:36.000
It was to see me

1138
01:16:47.716 --> 01:16:48.512
Taki ?

1139
01:16:57.688 --> 01:16:59.112
Mitsuha

1140
01:17:00.336 --> 01:17:01.284
Taki ?

1141
01:17:16.204 --> 01:17:17.628
Mitsuha

1142
01:17:18.464 --> 01:17:19.428
You're here, right ?

1143
01:17:20.624 --> 01:17:21.880
Inside my body ?

1144
01:17:22.668 --> 01:17:23.408
Taki

1145
01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.268
Taki, where are you ?

1146
01:17:27.176 --> 01:17:28.080
That was Mitsuha.

1147
01:17:29.392 --> 01:17:31.772
I can hear her voice, but...

1148
01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:34.556
Taki, where are you ?

1149
01:17:35.336 --> 01:17:36.288
Taki

1150
01:17:49.808 --> 01:17:51.912
Taki, are you...

1151
01:17:53.112 --> 01:17:54.028
Are you there ?

1152
01:18:19.912 --> 01:18:20.800
Magic hour.

1153
01:18:35.864 --> 01:18:36.640
Mitsuha.

1154
01:18:43.804 --> 01:18:44.448
Taki.

1155
01:18:45.912 --> 01:18:46.640
Taki.

1156
01:18:47.688 --> 01:18:48.888
You're really here.

1157
01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:54.800
Taki

1158
01:18:54.912 --> 01:18:56.440
I came all this way to see you.

1159
01:18:57.448 --> 01:18:58.512
It wasn't easy

1160
01:18:59.064 --> 01:19:00.752
Since you were pretty far away.

1161
01:19:02.932 --> 01:19:03.840
How is that even... ?

1162
01:19:04.664 --> 01:19:06.192
Because back then...

1163
01:19:06.264 --> 01:19:08.600
Well, I drank some of your kuchikamisake.

1164
01:19:12.316 --> 01:19:13.228
You

1165
01:19:13.824 --> 01:19:14.772
You drink that ?

1166
01:19:16.176 --> 01:19:18.172
Stupid pervert
What ?

1167
01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:19.408
Yeah that's right.

1168
01:19:19.424 --> 01:19:21.424
You were touching my boobies,
weren't you ?

1169
01:19:22.152 --> 01:19:23.608
How do you even

1170
01:19:23.624 --> 01:19:25.112
Cause Yotsuha saw you.

1171
01:19:25.424 --> 01:19:27.552
I just... I couldn't help myself.

1172
01:19:27.716 --> 01:19:28.912
It was just the one time.

1173
01:19:29.116 --> 01:19:30.332
Just the one time ?

1174
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.752
How many times isn't the issue

1175
01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:36.172
Sorry.

1176
01:19:36.828 --> 01:19:38.752
Wait, is that...

1177
01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:40.064
Oh

1178
01:19:40.332 --> 01:19:41.352
Yeah, It's yours.

1179
01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:43.000
But you visited before I knew you.

1180
01:19:43.716 --> 01:19:45.400
So I didn't know where you were.

1181
01:19:46.512 --> 01:19:47.080
Here.

1182
01:19:48.064 --> 01:19:49.480
I kept it for 3 years.

1183
01:19:50.264 --> 01:19:52.116
But I think it's time you got it back.

1184
01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:03.792
What do you think ?

1185
01:20:03.884 --> 01:20:06.592
Oh well, it's not bad.

1186
01:20:06.936 --> 01:20:08.200
Oh, you're lying

1187
01:20:10.176 --> 01:20:10.712
Busted.

1188
01:20:10.824 --> 01:20:12.628
Why you gotta be like that ?

1189
01:20:27.488 --> 01:20:28.840
Hey Mitsuha,

1190
01:20:29.248 --> 01:20:30.468
You still have a lot to do

1191
01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:31.680
Listen.

1192
01:20:32.888 --> 01:20:33.552
It's coming.

1193
01:20:34.376 --> 01:20:35.084
Don't worry.

1194
01:20:35.516 --> 01:20:37.732
You still have enough time.

1195
01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:38.868
I'll do my best.

1196
01:20:40.732 --> 01:20:42.932
It looks like Magic Hour is almost...

1197
01:20:43.572 --> 01:20:44.152
Over.

1198
01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:47.712
Hey, Mitsuha.

1199
01:20:48.316 --> 01:20:50.480
Just so we don't forget things
When we wake up...

1200
01:20:55.424 --> 01:20:56.880
Let's write our names.

1201
01:20:58.152 --> 01:20:58.600
Here.

1202
01:21:11.064 --> 01:21:11.880
Mitsuha ?

1203
01:21:14.864 --> 01:21:16.952
Hey, Mitsuha ?

1204
01:21:25.664 --> 01:21:27.132
I was planning to tell you.

1205
01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:30.772
That wherever you are in the world,

1206
01:21:30.992 --> 01:21:33.716
I swear that I'll find you
again no matter what.

1207
01:21:37.576 --> 01:21:39.640
Your name is Mitsuha.

1208
01:21:41.248 --> 01:21:42.192
It'll be ok.

1209
01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:43.248
I'll remember.

1210
01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:44.572
Mitsuha.

1211
01:21:44.888 --> 01:21:45.600
Mitsuha.

1212
01:21:45.716 --> 01:21:46.316
Mitsuha.

1213
01:21:46.732 --> 01:21:47.880
Your name is Mitsuha.

1214
01:21:48.116 --> 01:21:49.376
Your name is..

1215
01:22:00.592 --> 01:22:02.840
Who are you ?

1216
01:22:05.132 --> 01:22:08.064
And what did I even come here for ?

1217
01:22:08.976 --> 01:22:11.840
I came...
I came all this way to see her.

1218
01:22:12.288 --> 01:22:13.680
I came to save her.

1219
01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.688
I wanted her to be alive.

1220
01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:17.316
Who was it again ?

1221
01:22:17.712 --> 01:22:18.336
Who ?

1222
01:22:18.776 --> 01:22:20.196
Who did I come to see ?

1223
01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:22.040
Someone precious.

1224
01:22:22.356 --> 01:22:23.952
Someone I don't want to forget.

1225
01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:25.792
Someone I shouldn't

1226
01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:27.732
Who was it ?

1227
01:22:28.132 --> 01:22:29.176

Shouldn't it be going off ?

1274
01:24:14.688 --> 01:24:15.572

It was pretty loud too.

1281
01:24:29.176 --> 01:24:29.992

1288
01:24:55.512 --> 01:24:57.064
Hey, look up there

1289
01:25:06.848 --> 01:25:09.332
This is Itomori Town Hall.

1290
01:25:10.176 --> 01:25:14.088
Reports of an explosion at the
substation are coming in.

1291
01:25:14.112 --> 01:25:15.064
Did I hear that right ?

1292
01:25:15.132 --> 01:25:18.828
Wildfires are possible as well as
the threat of more explosions.

1293
01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:21.684
Residents in the following areas,

1294
01:25:22.008 --> 01:25:25.200
Please evacuate to Itomori
High School immediately.

1295
01:25:26.408 --> 01:25:27.772
Kadoiri District,

1296
01:25:28.736 --> 01:25:30.064
Sakagami District,

1297
01:25:31.428 --> 01:25:32.020
The broadcast isn't coming from us ?

1298
01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:34.552
Well, who the hell is it then ?

1299
01:25:34.824 --> 01:25:36.196
Miyamori District...

1300
01:25:37.512 --> 01:25:39.000
Oyazawa District...

1301
01:25:40.156 --> 01:25:41.352
Let's go, Mitsuha

1302
01:25:43.736 --> 01:25:44.556
Tessie

1303
01:25:46.332 --> 01:25:49.592
Reports of an explosion at the
substation are coming in.

1304
01:25:51.288 --> 01:25:54.532
Everyone run.
There's a wildfire

1305
01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:56.712
Wildfire, Please run

1306
01:25:56.732 --> 01:25:57.712
Get out of here

1307
01:25:58.008 --> 01:26:01.776
Run, there's a fire
It's not safe here, please evacuate

1308
01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:03.664
It's not working.
We're running out of time

1309
01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:04.992
Mitsuha

1310
01:26:06.712 --> 01:26:07.512
What's wrong ?

1311
01:26:08.684 --> 01:26:09.576
What is it ?

1312
01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:12.952
I can't remember what
his name is anymore

1313
01:26:15.484 --> 01:26:16.572
What is with you ?

1314
01:26:16.804 --> 01:26:18.732
You're the one who started all this

1315
01:26:19.288 --> 01:26:22.000
We can't evacuate everyone
without firefighters

1316
01:26:22.736 --> 01:26:23.376
Get going,

1317
01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:25.008
You've got to convince your old man

1318
01:26:33.312 --> 01:26:36.268
Everybody get to the high school
Hurry

1319
01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.372
Oh, Mitsuha.

1320
01:26:43.932 --> 01:26:45.828
Why would terrorists attack
way out here ?

1321
01:26:45.916 --> 01:26:48.192
What's Chubu Electric saying ?
They're still checking

1322
01:26:48.796 --> 01:26:49.480
Any update ?

1323
01:26:49.888 --> 01:26:50.976
No wildfires yet ?

1324
01:26:51.332 --> 01:26:52.064
You sure ?

1325
01:26:52.192 --> 01:26:52.752
Got it

1326
01:26:54.532 --> 01:26:56.828
Make them stop this broadcast immediately

1327
01:26:56.848 --> 01:26:58.640
Haven't you located its source yet

1328
01:26:58.712 --> 01:27:01.332
Mayor The Takayama sensor
station just called

1329
01:27:02.608 --> 01:27:03.752
From the high school ?

1330
01:27:04.312 --> 01:27:07.316
Once again residents in the following areas,

1331
01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:10.352
Please evacuate to Itomori High School.
Oh...

1332
01:27:10.428 --> 01:27:12.200
What are you doing ?
Turn that off

1333
01:27:15.288 --> 01:27:16.228
They got Saya

1334
01:27:16.488 --> 01:27:17.268
Oh no.

1335
01:27:20.976 --> 01:27:23.488
What were you thinking, Natori ?
I swear

1336
01:27:27.356 --> 01:27:29.640
This is Itomori Town Hall.

1337
01:27:30.848 --> 01:27:34.224
We are currently confirming
the reports of the accident.

1338
01:27:35.712 --> 01:27:39.932
We instruct all residents to remain calm
and stay where they are until further notice.

1339
01:27:39.936 --> 01:27:41.712
I guess we have to stay put ?

1340
01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:44.488
- What is going on ?
- So we stay on standby ?

1341
01:27:45.628 --> 01:27:48.040
Come on, they said everyone should evacuate

1342
01:27:48.392 --> 01:27:50.484
The high school is the evacuation center

1343
01:27:50.488 --> 01:27:51.552
Katsuhiko

1344
01:27:54.844 --> 01:27:55.536
Tell me.

1345
01:27:55.864 --> 01:27:57.404
What do you think you are doing ?

1346
01:28:00.772 --> 01:28:01.880
Sorry, Mitsuha.

1347
01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:04.664
This is the end.

1348
01:28:07.284 --> 01:28:07.992
Oh my god

1349
01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:10.224
It's actually splitting apart

1350
01:28:17.848 --> 01:28:18.576
Look at that

1351
01:28:18.808 --> 01:28:23.352
The comet has split in two large parts
and meteors are now falling to Earth

1352
01:28:24.228 --> 01:28:26.136
I don't believe anyone
could have predicted this.

1353
01:28:26.192 --> 01:28:28.532
Either way we have quite
the mystical view here.

1354
01:28:28.536 --> 01:28:31.400
So what does the comet's nucleus
splitting mean for us ?

1355
01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:33.716
The comet is not within the Roche limit.

1356
01:28:33.732 --> 01:28:37.600
So the nucleus itself must had a
structural weakness for this to happen...

1357
01:28:37.808 --> 01:28:42.840
Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 broke apart
and collided with Jupiter in 1994.

1358
01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:44.440
There are at least 21 fragments...

1359
01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:45.592
I'm going outside to take a look

1360
01:28:45.596 --> 01:28:48.408
The fragments will likely burn up
well before reaching the ground.

1361
01:28:48.776 --> 01:28:53.064
Probability of a meteor actually landing
on a populated area is quite small...

1362
01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:56.248
To predict the trajectory...

1363
01:28:56.312 --> 01:28:58.352
As we stand here witnessing this spectacle...

1364
01:28:58.824 --> 01:29:01.552
Unassisted and with our bare eyes...

1365
01:29:01.664 --> 01:29:05.840
It strikes me that living in such an age
has never felt more fortunate than now.

1366
01:29:09.660 --> 01:29:10.440
Hey.

1367
01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:13.280
Who are you ?

1368
01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:17.484
Who ?

1369
01:29:18.648 --> 01:29:19.192
Who ?

1370
01:29:20.464 --> 01:29:21.440
Who is he ?

1371
01:29:22.316 --> 01:29:23.592
Someone precious.

1372
01:29:24.088 --> 01:29:25.480
Someone I shouldn't forget.

1373
01:29:26.068 --> 01:29:27.772
Someone I didn't want to

1374
01:29:28.848 --> 01:29:29.408
Who ?

1375
01:29:29.552 --> 01:29:31.040
Who ?

1376
01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:32.848
Who are you ?

1377
01:29:33.512 --> 01:29:34.776
What's your name ?

1378
01:29:41.316 --> 01:29:41.932
Oh no

1379
01:30:01.864 --> 01:30:03.840
So that we don't forget things
when we wake up,

1380
01:30:04.576 --> 01:30:05.848
Let's write down our names.

1381
01:30:16.024 --> 01:30:18.480
"I love you"

1382
01:30:33.756 --> 01:30:36.248
Writing this doesn't help.

1383
01:30:36.808 --> 01:30:38.480
I won't know your name.

1384
01:30:51.248 --> 01:30:52.932
Dad

1385
01:30:54.952 --> 01:30:56.592
- Mitsuha
- There you are

1386
01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:58.428
Don't tell me you're back...

1387
01:31:03.132 --> 01:31:05.628
It was almost like seeing
something out of dream.

1388
01:31:06.604 --> 01:31:07.976
Nothing more or less

1389
01:31:08.372 --> 01:31:09.888

What am I doing ?

1401
01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:17.592
The door are closing
Please be careful

1402
01:33:20.712 --> 01:33:22.664
I'm always searching for something.

1403
01:33:23.460 --> 01:33:28.268
This feeling has consumed
me for some time.

1404
01:33:30.372 --> 01:33:32.268
The reason I applied for this position...

1405
01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:33.912
The landscapes people live in...

1406
01:33:34.060 --> 01:33:35.592
To build a city's landscape...

1407
01:33:35.888 --> 01:33:38.552
Even Tokyo, it might vanish too one day.

1408
01:33:38.792 --> 01:33:41.484
And so I want to make landscapes that...

1409
01:33:41.792 --> 01:33:43.132
How should I put this...

1410
01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:46.600
That can continue to warm peoples' hearts.

1411
01:33:48.448 --> 01:33:49.352
That bad ?

1412
01:33:49.428 --> 01:33:50.488
How many does that make it ?

1413
01:33:50.756 --> 01:33:51.992
I've stopped counting.

1414
01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.424
- Doesn't sound too promising
- Who asked you ?

1415
01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:56.112
That suit could be the problem.

1416
01:33:56.116 --> 01:33:57.592
It looks just like yours

1417
01:33:57.596 --> 01:34:00.424
- Well, I have 2 offers.
- I have 8 myself.

1418
01:34:03.664 --> 01:34:05.752
"Line: You have a new message."

1419
01:34:06.312 --> 01:34:10.888
Is what I'm searching for
someone or somewhere ?

1420
01:34:12.172 --> 01:34:14.736
Or am I just searching
for the right job ?

1421
01:34:15.316 --> 01:34:16.776
I don't even really know.

1422
01:34:18.112 --> 01:34:20.592
Oh, you're job-hunting huh ?

1423
01:34:20.684 --> 01:34:22.268
I haven't had much luck though.

1424
01:34:23.192 --> 01:34:25.516
Hey, maybe its the suit
that's killing your chances.

1425
01:34:25.532 --> 01:34:27.200
Does it really look that bad on me ?

1426
01:34:31.332 --> 01:34:34.284
So, why the sudden call today ?

1427
01:34:34.972 --> 01:34:39.400
I was in the area for work and I figured
I'd been a while since I saw your face.

1428
01:34:39.532 --> 01:34:41.488
"8 years since the comet disaster"

1429
01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:45.628
Remember that one time when
we went all the way to Itomori ?

1430
01:34:46.156 --> 01:34:49.080
You were still in high school
back then, so it was...

1431
01:34:50.152 --> 01:34:51.000
5 years ago.

1432
01:34:51.248 --> 01:34:52.132
That long ?

1433
01:34:53.288 --> 01:34:56.088
It seems like I've forgotten a lot.

1434
01:34:57.312 --> 01:34:59.600
I don't remember all that much either...

1435
01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:01.000
About back then.

1436
01:35:02.152 --> 01:35:03.440
Maybe we argued...

1437
01:35:04.264 --> 01:35:06.808
She and Tsukasa went back
to Tokyo without me.

1438
01:35:08.048 --> 01:35:10.392
I spent the night alone
on some mountain.

1439
01:35:11.772 --> 01:35:13.152
That's about all I remember.

1440
01:35:16.464 --> 01:35:18.440
But at one point in time,

1441
01:35:18.756 --> 01:35:22.628
I found myself strangely drawn
to the events involving that comet.

1442
01:35:25.608 --> 01:35:28.716
A fragment of the comet destroyed
a town in that disaster.

1443
01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:29.312
"Evacuation of residents to
high school grounds confirmed"

1444
01:35:29.572 --> 01:35:33.376
But miracurously, most of the people
living in that town were unhurt.

1445
01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:37.552
The town happened to be holding
an emergency drill that day.

1446
01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:37.992
"An unprecedented natural disaster"

1447
01:35:38.064 --> 01:35:40.848

1451
01:35:48.428 --> 01:35:50.400
I read a lot of articles about it back then.

1452
01:35:51.264 --> 01:35:52.428
I was kinda of obsessed.

1453
01:35:53.712 --> 01:35:56.488
But whatever the reason
I had for my interest,

1454
01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:59.268
Is a mystery to me now.

1455
01:36:00.408 --> 01:36:02.376
I didn't even know anybody in that town.

1456
01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:07.440
Thanks for today.

1457
01:36:07.664 --> 01:36:08.792
This is far enough.

1458
01:36:10.312 --> 01:36:13.628
I do hope that at some point,

1459
01:36:14.064 --> 01:36:15.732
You'll find happiness too.

They're all the same.

1465
01:36:41.824 --> 01:36:43.932
A Shinto wedding sure sounds nice too.

1466
01:36:43.936 --> 01:36:46.080
You said you wanted to
be married in a chapel.

Oh, that reminds me Tessie.

1468

Would you please shave
before the ceremony ?
